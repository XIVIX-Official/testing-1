# testing-1

This is a practice repository for learning how to use GitHub.

## âœ… Task for Each Team Member

1. Go to the **XIVIX** profile on GitHub.  

2. Click the **Follow** button.  
   *(This helps you stay updated with any changes or new repositories.)*

3. Navigate to the **Repositories** tab on the profile.  
   *(This is where all the public projects of **XIVIX** are listed.)*

4. Find the **testing-1** repository and click on it.  
   *(This is the repository you'll be working on for practice.)*

5. Click the **Star** button on the repository.  
   *(Starring helps you bookmark the project for later.)*

6. **Fork** or **clone** the repository.  
   *(Forking creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. Cloning downloads the repo to your computer. This allows you to work on your own copy.)*

7. Create a new file in the `team/` folder with your name (e.g., `john.txt`).  
   *(This is a simple task to help you practice how to contribute to a project.)*

8. Inside the file, write a **fun fact** or a **short message**.  
   *(Just a small personal message â€” this is mainly for practicing edits and commits.)*

9. **Commit** your changes.  
   *(A commit is like saving your changes with a message describing what you did.)*

10. **Push** your branch or open a **pull request**.  
    *(Pushing sends your changes to GitHub. A pull request lets **XIVIX** review and possibly merge your changes into the main project (`testing-1`).)*
